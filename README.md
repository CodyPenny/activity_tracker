# Streak - A Mobile Social Activity Tracker

***

## Introduction

Streak is a social networking app that allows users to create an activity, add friends, and keep track of the activity's progress incentivizing its completion in a fun and enjoyable way.

## Project Description

Revamped a previously worked project with considerations to improving features and exploring Google Firebase. 

The application takes a mobile first approach and shifts the development to adapt to mobile screens while scaling down on desktop screens to showcase its capabilities as a mobile product as if it is a iOS or Android but is a web app.

Users can register and login using an email and password or Google account.
